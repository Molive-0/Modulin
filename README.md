# Modulin
Some files relating to the Modulin synth I created. See http://www.slipstreamdemo.info/?p=82

The modulinmulticore.py is the synth. It requires PYO, the adafruit adc drivers and a linux enviroment. It may take a few tries to start correctly.
The gerber files are the pcb.
There are also some .wav files from early testing, including the one used in the final video.

I haven't put any more comments in the code so, uh, good luck.
